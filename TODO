Add letter frequencies and use the possibility with the highest letter frequency sum
- Multiples of a particular letter should only count toward the total sum once as opposed
  to just blindly disallowing words with dupes. This will allow words with lots of common
  letters but a dupe still have a higher frequency sum than a word with all unique but
  uncommon letters.

Use guess history to pick better guesses
- For example, if we've guessed an A in the first position and it was correct but wrong
  position, then for our next guess, try to get the A in a different position if the guess
  has an A.

Don't require picking a word from the possiblities
- Known positions can be used to experiment with on subsequent guesses if unlikely to
  guess the word on the next guess
